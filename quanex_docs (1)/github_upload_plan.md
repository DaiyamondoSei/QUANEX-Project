## Alternative Upload Methods

### Using GitHub Web Interface

If you prefer not to use Git commands:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/DaiyamondoSei/QUANEX-Project in your browser
2. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop files or use the file selector
4. Add a commit message and commit directly to the main branch

### Using GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI application:

1. Install GitHub Desktop
2. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop
3. Drag and drop the files from the organized structure
4. Add a commit message and push to GitHub

## File Organization

Ensure the following structure is maintained when uploading:

```
QUANEX-Project/
├── README.md                 # Main project overview
├── docs/                     # Documentation files
│   ├── README.md             # Documentation index
│   ├── quanex_knowledge_base.md

├── architecture/             # Architecture documentation
│   └── README.md             # Architecture overview
├── design/                   # Design assets and documentation
│   └── README.md             # Design overview
└── code/                     # Implementation code
    └── README.md             # Code overview
```

## Post-Upload Tasks

After successfully uploading to GitHub:

1. Verify all files appear correctly in the repository
2. Check that all README files render properly
3. Test navigation between documents
4. Set up GitHub Pages if you want to publish the documentation as a website
5. Configure repository settings (collaborators, branch protection, etc.)

## Maintenance Plan

To keep the GitHub repository up-to-date:

1. Update documentation as the project evolves
2. Add new code implementations as they are developed
3. Maintain a clear commit history with descriptive messages
4. Consider using branches for major feature development
5. Regularly review and clean up the repository structure
