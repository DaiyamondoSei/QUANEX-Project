# QUANEX Design

This directory contains all design-related assets and documentation for the QUANEX (Quantum Nexus) project, including UI/UX designs, wireframes, and visual elements.

## Design Philosophy

The QUANEX design follows a cosmic visual theme inspired by quantum physics and consciousness exploration, featuring:

- Dark background with quantum-like imagery and particle effects
- Sacred geometry patterns and energy visualizations
- Glowing light effects and gradient color transitions
- Clean, modern typography with clear hierarchy
- Interactive elements that respond to user engagement

## Color Palette

- **Deep Space Blue** (#0A0E17) - Primary background color
- **Cosmic Purple** (#3A1C71) - Secondary background and accent
- **Quantum Blue** (#00F0FF) - Primary accent color for interactive elements
- **Energy Orange** (#FF7E5F) - Secondary accent for highlights and calls-to-action
- **Consciousness Purple** (#8E2DE2) - Tertiary accent for gradients
- **Pure White** (#FFFFFF) - Text and high-contrast elements
- **Light Blue** (#E0F7FF) - Secondary text color

## Typography

- **Heading Font**: Montserrat (Bold, Semi-Bold)
- **Body Font**: Inter (Regular, Medium)

## UI Components

The design system includes these key components:

- Animated particle backgrounds
- Glass-morphism cards with hover effects
- Energy beam and ring visualizations
- Quantum parameter visualization components
- Meditation progress tracking interfaces
- Dream visualization components
- Sacred geometry interactive elements

## Website Design

The website design follows the Huly.io-inspired aesthetic with:

- Full-screen hero section with animated elements
- Card-based feature presentation
- Asymmetrical content layout
- Interactive resource sections
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive design

## Mobile App Design

The mobile app design extends the website aesthetic with:

- Bottom tab navigation
- Swipeable card interfaces
