   - Privacy controls for sharing information

2. **API Security**
   - Authentication and authorization for all endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

3. **Compliance**
   - GDPR compliance for European users
   - CCPA compliance for California users
   - Clear data usage policies and consent management

This architecture plan provides a solid foundation for developing the QUANEX application with scalability, security, and user experience as primary considerations. The modular approach allows for incremental development and testing while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and user feedback.
