# QUANEX Project: Updated Documentation

## Project Overview

QUANEX (Quantum Nexus) is a revolutionary consciousness accelerator app that bridges spirituality and quantum physics through gamified experiences. This document serves as an updated compilation of all project documentation, reflecting the latest developments and plans for the project.

## Documentation Components

The QUANEX project documentation now consists of the following components:

1. **Knowledge Base**: A comprehensive overview of the QUANEX concept, features, target audience, and business model that serves as the single source of truth for the project.

2. **Architecture Plan**: A detailed technical architecture design that outlines the system components, data models, scalability considerations, and development roadmap.

3. **Divine Intelligence (DI) AI API Specification**: A complete specification for the AI guidance system that is central to the QUANEX app, including detailed endpoint designs, request/response formats, and implementation considerations.

4. **Backend-First Development Approach**: A detailed plan for implementing the QUANEX app starting with the backend infrastructure and API development before focusing on the frontend.

5. **Website Resources Content**: Comprehensive content for the Resources section of the QUANEX website, addressing the blank pages issue and providing valuable information for users.

## Current Status

The QUANEX project has progressed significantly with the following achievements:

- ✅ Concept development and vision definition
- ✅ Website prototype creation at https://lunwtdci.manus.space/
- ✅ Initial app prototype development (with SDK compatibility issues to be resolved)
- ✅ Comprehensive knowledge base creation
- ✅ Detailed architecture planning
- ✅ Divine Intelligence API specification
- ✅ Backend-first development approach
- ✅ Website resources content creation

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- Set up development environment with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB
- Implement database schemas for users, meditation sessions, and quantum parameters
- Create authentication system with JWT
- Develop basic user management functionality

### Phase 2: Core API Development (Weeks 3-4)

- Implement meditation tracking endpoints
- Develop quantum parameters framework
- Create basic challenge system
- Build initial recommendation engine

### Phase 3: Website Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)

- Implement resources section with the created content
- Add interactive elements like guided meditation players
- Implement search functionality for resources
- Create community forum integration

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (Weeks 7-8)

- Design user interface based on the five quantum parameters
- Implement meditation tracking and analysis screens
- Create visualization components for quantum parameters
- Develop challenge and achievement system interface

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (Weeks 9-10)

- Connect frontend to backend APIs
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Conduct user testing with representatives from each consciousness band
- Refine user experience based on feedback

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Backend Infrastructure**: Establish the core backend components as outlined in the backend-first approach
2. **Website Resources**: Implement the resources content to provide value to users immediately
3. **Divine Intelligence API**: Develop the key DI API endpoints for meditation analysis and quantum parameters
4. **Frontend Development**: Create the user interface for the core features
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly

## Technical Considerations

### SDK Compatibility Issues

The current prototype has compatibility issues with SDK 52 and newer versions of Expo Go. Once the prototype code is located, the following steps will be taken:

1. Update dependencies to latest versions
2. Migrate from SDK 52 to the latest Expo SDK
3. Refactor code to use current API patterns
4. Test on current versions of Expo Go

### Backend Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web application framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript superset
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible schema
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication

### AI and Machine Learning

- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning framework
- **Natural**: Natural language processing library
- **Brain.js**: Neural network library
- **Synaptic**: Architecture-free neural network library

## Website Resources Implementation

The Resources section of the QUANEX website will be structured with the following categories:

1. **Quantum Physics Fundamentals**
2. **Meditation & Consciousness Practices**
3. **Scientific Research**
4. **Recommended Reading**
5. **Video Resources**
6. **Community & Events**
7. **Developer Resources**

Each category will have its own page with detailed content as outlined in the website resources document. The implementation will include:

- Tab-based navigation between resource categories
- Interactive elements like guided meditation players
- Downloadable resources and PDFs
- Search functionality to find specific resources
- Regular content updates schedule

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Backend Implementation**: Start developing the core backend infrastructure and API endpoints
2. **Implement Website Resources**: Add the created content to the Resources section of the website
3. **Continue Searching for Prototype Code**: Locate the prototype code to address SDK compatibility issues
4. **Develop Minimum Viable Product**: Create a working prototype with core features
5. **Prepare Business Plan**: Develop a comprehensive business plan for university approval

## Conclusion

The QUANEX project now has a solid foundation of comprehensive documentation and a clear development plan. By following the backend-first approach and implementing the website resources, the project can move forward efficiently toward creating a revolutionary consciousness accelerator app that bridges spirituality and quantum physics through gamified experiences.
