# AI API Options Analysis for QUANEX

## Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of various AI API options for the Divine Intelligence (DI) component of the QUANEX consciousness accelerator app. The DI component requires natural language processing, personalized recommendations, pattern recognition, and potentially visualization generation capabilities.

## Requirements for the Divine Intelligence Component

Based on the QUANEX project documentation, the Divine Intelligence component needs to:

1. Analyze meditation sessions and provide insights
2. Generate personalized recommendations based on user progress
3. Recognize patterns in user experiences and consciousness development
4. Provide guidance aligned with the user's consciousness band
5. Generate visualizations for dreams and quantum parameters
6. Facilitate natural conversation with users

- Gradually transition to more powerful commercial APIs as funding becomes available

**Advantages:**
- Cost-effective for a startup
- Scalable as the project grows
- Balances capability with budget constraints
- Provides flexibility to adapt based on user needs

**Challenges:**
- More complex to implement and maintain
