## Research Documents

### Gamification Frameworks Research

The project research focused heavily on the Octalysis Framework by Yu-kai Chou, which provides eight core drives for gamification:

1. Epic Meaning & Calling
2. Development & Accomplishment
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
4. Ownership & Possession
5. Social Influence & Relatedness
6. Scarcity & Impatience
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity
8. Loss & Avoidance

These core drives align well with the QUANEX concept of gamifying consciousness development and can be mapped to the five quantum parameters:

- **Coherence** relates to Development & Accomplishment and Epic Meaning & Calling
- **Entanglement** relates to Social Influence & Relatedness
- **Superposition** relates to Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
- **Observation** relates to Unpredictability & Curiosity
- **Resonance** relates to Epic Meaning & Calling and Ownership & Possession

### Consciousness App Research

Research on existing consciousness and spiritual development apps included:

1. **Mind: Spiritual Awakening** by Gradoid DOO
   - 4.7 stars (1.38K reviews)
   - 100K+ downloads
   - Features: 5-minute lessons on spiritual topics, tools for practicing spiritual skills, dream tracking, meditation tracker

2. **Insight Timer**
   - Meditation app with spiritual components
   - Features community aspects and guided practices

These apps provide valuable reference points for QUANEX's feature set and user experience design.

## Code Files

Throughout the conversations, several code files were referenced:

1. `consciousness_app_project/app_research.md` - Research notes on existing apps
2. `consciousness_app_project/todo.md` - Task tracking for project development
3. `consciousness_app_project/app_prototype_proposal.md` - Initial prototype proposal

There was mention of a prototype zip file with SDK 52 compatibility issues, but the file itself was not found in the conversation history.

## Website Content

The QUANEX website (https://lunwtdci.manus.space/) was created with the following sections:

1. Vision
2. Framework
3. Features
4. Science
5. Roadmap
6. Resources (currently blank)

The Resources section requires implementation of the content created in the website_resources_content.md document.

## Project Documentation

The project documentation has evolved through several iterations:

1. Initial concept exploration
2. Research on existing apps and gamification frameworks
3. Development of the QUANEX concept with five quantum parameters
4. Creation of comprehensive documentation including architecture and API specifications
5. Development of a backend-first approach
6. Planning for website improvements

## Next Steps

Based on the extracted documents, the next steps for the project are:

1. Implement the backend infrastructure following the backend-first approach
2. Add content to the Resources section of the website
3. Resolve the SDK 52 compatibility issues with the prototype code
4. Select an appropriate AI API for the Divine Intelligence component
5. Develop a minimum viable product for testing

## AI API Considerations

For the Divine Intelligence component, several AI API options are being considered:

1. OpenAI API
2. Grok 3
3. Claude API (Anthropic)
4. Hugging Face
5. TensorFlow.js

The recommendation is to start with Hugging Face's open-source models or TensorFlow.js for the initial prototype to minimize costs, with the option to transition to more powerful commercial APIs as the project grows.
