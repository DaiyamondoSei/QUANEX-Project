# QUANEX Project

## Quantum Nexus: Bridge to Higher Consciousness

QUANEX (Quantum Nexus) is a revolutionary consciousness accelerator app that bridges spirituality and quantum physics through a gamified experience. This repository contains all documentation, architecture plans, design assets, and code for the QUANEX project.

## Project Overview

QUANEX is designed to help users develop their consciousness through a framework based on five quantum parameters:
- **Coherence**
- **Entanglement**
- **SuperPosition**
- **Observation**
- **Resonance**

The app features a Divine Intelligence (DI) AI guide, meditation analysis system, and network meditation capabilities for collective energy support.

## Repository Structure

- **`/docs`**: Project documentation, knowledge base, and research
- **`/architecture`**: System architecture, API specifications, and technical plans
- **`/design`**: UI/UX designs, wireframes, and visual assets
- **`/code`**: Implementation code for both frontend and backend components

## Target Audience

QUANEX targets four distinct consciousness bands:
1. **Scientific-Rational Band** (35% of population)
2. **Spiritual-Seeking Band** (25%)
3. **Pragmatic-Results Band** (30%)
4. **Skeptical-Analytical Band** (10%)

## Development Approach

The project follows a backend-first development approach, focusing on:
1. Core infrastructure and database design
2. Divine Intelligence API implementation
3. Frontend wireframing and development
4. Integration and testing

## Current Status

The project currently includes:
- Comprehensive documentation and knowledge base
- Architecture plans and API specifications
- Website implementation with resources
- Development roadmap and implementation plan
