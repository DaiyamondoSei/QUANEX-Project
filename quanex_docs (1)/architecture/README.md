# QUANEX Architecture

This directory contains all architecture-related documentation for the QUANEX (Quantum Nexus) project, including system design, API specifications, and technical implementation plans.

## Key Architecture Documents

The following documents provide comprehensive information about the QUANEX architecture:

- **Architecture Plan** - System architecture overview with components and data models
- **DI AI API Specification** - Complete specification for the Divine Intelligence AI system
- **Backend-First Approach** - Implementation plan focusing on backend development
- **Architecture & Prototype Phase Plan** - Detailed plan for architecture and prototype development

## Architecture Overview

The QUANEX architecture follows a modern, scalable design with these key components:

### Client Layer
- React Native mobile application
- Web interface for dashboard access
- Meditation analysis visualization components

### API Layer
- RESTful API endpoints for all app functionality
- WebSocket connections for real-time meditation analysis
- Authentication and authorization services

### Service Layer
- Divine Intelligence AI service
- Meditation analysis engine
- Quantum parameters tracking system
- User journey management
- Community and collective meditation features

### Data Layer
- User profiles and authentication data
- Meditation session recordings and analysis
- Quantum parameters progress tracking
- Challenge and achievement system
- Community interaction data

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a backend-first approach with these phases:

1. Core infrastructure and database setup
2. Divine Intelligence API implementation
3. Meditation analysis engine development
4. Frontend development with React Native
5. Integration and testing

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **AI Components**: Hybrid approach with Hugging Face, TensorFlow.js, Claude API
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Real-time Features**: WebSockets, Socket.io
- **Deployment**: Cloud-based infrastructure

## Diagrams and Visual Documentation

Architecture diagrams and visual documentation will be added to this directory as they are developed.
